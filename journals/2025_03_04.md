	- tried the solution given in stackoverflow
	- attempt failed for some specific scenarios, i.e. any blank space before german language specific characters caused new issues on tokenization
- ### 12:56
	- let's try modifying the starting and ending index calculation
	- hardcode for every misdecoded special characters
	- | Character | UTF-8 Bytes | Misdecoded as Latin-1 | Resulting String |
	  |-----------|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|

	- there might be many more special characters like this
	- but so far in our dataset, I didn't find any other special characters
- ### 14:38
	- after adding all those hardcoded fix for some special characters, trying to fine-tune again
	- complete the whole implementation including data prediction, evaluation etc
- ### 14:53
	- GPT2 model finetuing is completed within 8 minutes, with 300 annotated samples
	- try to evaluate randomly selected 20 unseen test samples, and the result is as follows
	- background-color:: blue

	  |----------------|--------|
	  | Precision      | 0.2727 |
	  | Recall         | 0.3871 |
