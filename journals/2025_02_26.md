	- ![SD_ARTE_Bekehermes etal_12_23.pdf](../assets/SD_ARTE_Bekehermes_etal_12_23_1740592066629_0.pdf)
	- ARTE (Automated Regional Trains in Lower Saxony)
	- ECTS: European Train Control System
	- ATO: Automatic Train Operation
	- **GoA 4 (Fully Automated Operation based on Grade on Automation)**:
		- Automatic Train Operation (ATO) at Grade of Automation (GoA) Level 4
		- No driver or onboard staff required.
		- The system handles all operations, including door closing, emergency situations, and recovery from faults.
		- Often used in **metro and urban rail systems** (e.g., Copenhagen Metro, Dubai Metro, and some lines in Paris).
		- Typically combined with **CBTC (Communication-Based Train Control)** or **ETCS Level 3** for safety and real-time monitoring.
	- **GoA 3 (Driverless Operation)** :
		- 🚆 **No driver** in the cabin.
		- 👨‍✈️ **Onboard train attendant** (for emergency situations, door operation, or passenger assistance).
		- 🚦 **Automated acceleration, braking, and stopping** at stations.
		- 🛑 **Automatic obstacle detection and emergency braking** systems.
		- 🔄 **Can recover from certain disruptions** without human intervention.
	- **GoA 2 (Semi-Automatic Train Operation - STO)**:
		- ✅ **Automatic driving**: The train **accelerates, brakes, and stops automatically**.
		- ✅ **Driver required**: A human **driver remains in the cab** to handle **emergencies, door operation, and manual intervention** if needed.
		- ✅ **Automatic train protection (ATP)** ensures safety by preventing collisions and speeding.
		- 🚦 Usually combined with **CBTC (Communication-Based Train Control)** or **ETCS (European Train Control System) Level 2**.
