### Challenges in Future Rolling Stock for Peripheral Areas
	- ![Hertel_2023_Challenges in the (Re-)Connection of Peripheral Areas to the Rail Network from a Rolling Stock Perspective The Case of germany.pdf](../assets/Hertel_2023_Challenges_in_the_(Re-)Connection_of_Peripheral_Areas_to_the_Rail_Network_from_a_Rolling_Stock_Perspective_The_Case_of_germany_1743602960148_0.pdf)
	- Evaluation of Rolling Stock in Branch Line Service
		- Rolling Stock: Vehicles that move on a railway track
		- Branch Line Service: railway operations that connect smaller towns or rural areas to main railway lines
		- VLR: Very Light Rail
		- ARS: Autonomous Battery Electric  (90 Passengers, 100 km/h max speed roughly)
		- Axle Load: Load by each wagon of a Train
	- Potential Areas of application Derivation of a use Case
		- Challenges from the infrastructural conditions
			- Accessibility
			- Energy - Supply
			- Driverless driving
			- Train Meets
			- Batery and hydrogen powered
			- Vehicle homologation
	- What are rail route Categories?
		- Line A: High traffic, high-speed, heavy-axle load
		- Line B1 & B2: Important mainline with lower capacity than Line A
		- Line C: Regional and branch-line operations
		- Line D: Low-trafic branch lines
	- BEMU: Battery Electric Multiple Unit
	- HEMU: Hydrogen Electric MU
	- DLR: German Aerospace Centre
